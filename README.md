# barberapp
For my study HBO-ICT i need to build a webapp for a barber. The target is to make it easiear to make an appointment.

The project is in ownership of Nand Homan, Participant of Open-ict study at HU the Netherlands.

Special thanks to the people who helped me:

- Obe Jansen, Open-ict HU participant: Reviewed my project and gave me some feedback
